<h4> January 6, 2021 Version </h4>
<ul>
<li>Added variables indicating whether industries were open as of October 9 to January 1. <br>
   We have renamed all variables to include the year (either 2020 or 2021.)</li>
<li>Drawing on data collected by Christopher Adolph, Kenya Amano, Bree Bang-Jensen, Nancy <br>
   Fullman, and John Wilkerson (see https://github.com/COVID19StatePolicy/SocialDistancing ) <br>
   we have updated our measures of K-12 schools' (NAICS 6111) open/closed status.</li>
<li>Throughout November and December, an increasing proportion of California counties had <br>
   ‘substantial’ or ‘widespread’ COVID spread. As a result, offices, bars, entertainment, <br>
   and movie theaters were closed in a larger share of California. </li>
<li>New Mexico reinstated its original business closure order in the middle of November, <br>
   then moved to a targeted (by county) scheme. Throughout December, all counties (except <br>
   for Catron) are in the “red” (most restrictive) zone, with bars, and several entertainment<br>
   industries closed. </li>
<li>Arizona closed movie theaters and bars in the beginning of November.</li>
<li>In Illinois, indoor dining at bars and restaurants, casinos/gambling, performing arts<br>
   centers, museums, amusement centers closed as of 11/20/20. </li>
<li>As of November 27th, bars across Louisiana were allowed to open for outdoor service, delivery,<br>
   and take-out only. </li>
<li>New York introduced a Micro-Cluster strategy, defining regions below the county level. In<br>
   general, these micro clusters are substantially smaller than counties. For this reason, we<br>
   have designated industries as allowed to be open (if they were previously so).</li>
<li>Minnesota closed gyms, restaurants/bars, outdoor/indoor events and entertainment, organized<br>
   sports in mid November. In mid December restaurants and bars were allowed to open for outdoor <br>
   service.</li>
<li>Bars closed in Honolulu, Hawaii as of September 25th.</li>
<li>Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania closed gyms, theaters, bowling alleys, arcades, libraries,<br>
   and casinos with rising case counts on November 20. The remainder of the state followed suit in<br>
   early December. These state-wide restrictions were lifted in early January. </li>
<li>Rhode Island closed gyms, bars, and other entertainment venues on November 30.</li>
<li>Vermont closed bars on November 14.</li>
<li>Washington fully closed gyms, bowling centers, convention centers, sporting arenas, movie<br>
   theaters, museums to indoor service and reduced capacity in retail, religious services, and<br>
   personal services, in addition to other industries on November 16.</li>
<li>Michigan introduced a November 18th epidemic order “Pause to Save Lives” which closed <br>
   theaters, movie theaters, arenas, bowling centers, casinos, and organized sports (except <br>
    professional sports). This pause has been extended to the first weeks of 2021. </li>
<li>Beginning in mid November, Oregon instituted a county-based approach. In the last weeks of <br>
   November, offices, entertainment industries, bars and restaurants, gyms, bowling alleys, and<br>
   movie theaters were closed statewide. In December, these industries were closed in a subset of <br>
   Oregon’s counties.</li>
</ul>
<h4> October 5 Version </h4>
<ul>
<li>Added variables indicating whether industries were open as of August 14th to October 2nd</li>
<li>K-12 Schools: The below reopening of schools are coded based upon the following rule – <br>
   if any type of public school within a county or state has the option to reopen to in-person <br>
   learning in part or in full, we consider schools within the county or state as reopened   </li>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; padding-bottom: 0;">
<li style="margin-left:2em">New York permitted schools to reopen as of August 8 (however partial or full <br>
 reopening are decided at the district level)</li> 
<li style="margin-left:2em; padding-bottom: 0;">Delaware has begun partially reopening</li>
<li style="margin-left:2em; padding-bottom: 0;">New Mexico opened some elementary schools in certain counties</li>
<li style="margin-left:2em; padding-bottom: 0;">Vermont reopened public schools on September 8, with the frequency and extent<br>
of in-person learning decided on a district-by-district basis</li>
</ol>
<li>Iowa closed bars in 6 counties from August 28 to September 18</li>
<li>Washington introduced a Modified Phase 1 on August 27, which retained the original Phase 1<br>
openings and also reopened religious services to 25% capacity, taverns, breweries, wineries<br>
and distilleries, and increased retail capacity size from 15% to 30%; opened gyms statewide<br>
on September 11</li>
<li>Arizona fully reopened Maricopa, Pima, and Pinal counties on August 28; 8 counties<br>
 transferred from the Substantial to Moderate phase between August 27 and September 24<br>

<li>Florida opened casinos in Miami Dade County at the end of August. The temporary closure <br>
    of bars that began in June ended Sept 14 (for all counties except Miami Dade). Miami Dade<br>
    later reopened bars on September 25. The entire state entered the final phase of its<br> 
    reopening plan on September 25.</li>
<li>North Carolina reopened museums, aquariums, gyms, bowling alleys, golf courses, child care <br>
    centers, personal care industries, and restaurants on September 4.</li>
<li>Maryland entered stage three of their recovery on September 4 in which indoor theaters and<br>
    outdoor venues could reopen with limited capacity</li>
<li>New Jersey reopened amusement parks, college campuses, and indoor gyms on September<br>
    1, indoor theaters and performance venues on September 4</li>
<li>Colorado introduced a Dial Framework on September 14 which set business and capacity<br>
   restrictions for specific counties according to certain health metrics. For all but 5 counties, <br>
   this meant closed bars, reopened but limited schools, places of worship, gyms, retail, <br>
    offices, personal services, and manufacturing</li>
<li>California counties introduced Blueprint for a Safer Economy as of August 31, which<br>
   assigned each county a tier according to key metrics and reopened all retail, shopping<br>
   centers, and hair salons/barber shops subject to varying capacity limits. The changes in <br>
   sept25updates.do reflect the September 14th and September 29th tier assignments.</li> 
<li>Massachusetts reopened indoor and outdoor arcades beginning September 17 </li>
<li>Oregon moved Umatilla and Morrow counties to Phase 2 as of September 18th, which meant<br>
     that indoor arcades, movie theaters, and bowling alleys reopened with reduced capacity</li>
<li>Louisiana allowed bars with fewer than 5% positivity rate to open. The parishes included<br>
    on September 4 were Orleans, Jefferson Davis, St. John the Baptist, Bienville, and<br>
    Plaquemines. St. Landry, Acadia joined later by September 17</li>
