<li>K-12 Schools: The below reopening of schools are coded based upon the following rule â€“ <br>
   if any type of public school within a county or state has the option to reopen to in-person <br>
   learning in part or in full, we consider schools within the county or state as reopened   </li>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; padding-bottom: 0;">

   assigned each county a tier according to key metrics and reopened all retail, shopping<br>
