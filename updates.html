<h4> Otober 5 Version </h4>
<ul>
<li>Added variables indicating whether industries were open as of August 14th to October 2nd</li>
<li>K-12 Schools: The below reopening of schools are coded based upon the following<br>
   rule â€“ if any type of public school within a county or state has the option to <br>
   reopen to in-person learning in part or in full, we consider schools within the<br>
   county or state as reopened</li>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; padding-bottom: 0;">
<li style="margin-left:2em">New York permitted schools to reopen as of August 8 (however partial<br>
 or full reopening are decided at the district level)</li>

   assigned each county a tier according to key metrics and reopened all retail, shopping<br>
